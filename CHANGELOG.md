## Features

* **breaking changes**: Update the component in order to be compatible with **Ionic v4** and **Angular v6**

### Important note

I did not gave a try but this version might no be suitable anymore for Ionic v3 and Angular v5. If you are using the web-social-share component in such apps, you might better not upgrade and stick to the component version v1.1.0
